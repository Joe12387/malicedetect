# malicedetect.js
 A simple JS library to detect malicious browsers, including bots & browsers lying about their user agent.
 
 Note: This code is not tested enough to my satisfaction and may not function correctly.
 
TODO:
* Add more return data that describes exactly how the browser may be malicious.
* Add Incognito/Private Browsing detection.
* Add a LICENSE. Feel free to use the code for any purpose, I'm just uploading some repos that I've had lying around.
